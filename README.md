# 🚦 TrafficViz: Traffic Data Visualization Using Shiny

Welcome to **TrafficViz**! In this project, we’ll create an interactive dashboard using the Shiny framework in R to visualize and analyze traffic data. Our dashboard will allow users to explore Uber rides data, visualizing trends and patterns through interactive maps and charts. Let’s build a user-friendly and dynamic interface to explore traffic data! 🚗📊

## 🌐 Project Overview

In this project, we’ll use **Shiny** to build a web application that allows users to interactively explore Uber rides data. The dashboard will include various sections, each designed to provide unique insights into the data. We’ll visualize ride frequencies, geographic locations, and trends over time using tools like **ggplot2**, **Leaflet**, and **Plotly**. The goal is to create an intuitive and responsive interface where users can filter, view, and analyze traffic data interactively.
